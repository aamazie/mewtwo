#Rust Malware Scanner, MEWTWO


Implementing the Permissions Setup:

To set up permissions statically:

Linux:

Run the scanner with sudo:

sudo ./mewtwo.rs

Or set the binary with the setuid bit (not generally recommended for security reasons):

sudo chown root:root scanner_program

sudo chmod u+s scanner_program

Windows:

Run the program as Administrator.

Use a task scheduler to run the program with elevated privileges.


Key Improvements in the Rust Version

Memory Safety:

Rust prevents out-of-bounds access with its strong type system and borrow checker, ensuring that all accesses to memory are safe.

No manual memory management is required; Rust handles memory allocation and deallocation automatically.

Stack Canary Check:

The stack canary check is simulated with a direct comparison. While Rust's memory safety features eliminate many classes of vulnerabilities, this check demonstrates how you can still guard against logic errors.

Malware Signature Scanning:

The scan_for_malware function uses the windows iterator to scan memory slices safely. This prevents out-of-bounds access. 
starts_with is used to check if a slice matches the malware signature, making the code concise and readable.

Error Handling:

Rust provides robust error handling via the Result and Option types, ensuring that potential errors are handled explicitly.

No Unsafe Code:

The code avoids using Rust's unsafe keyword, adhering strictly to safe Rust practices.

Benefits of Using Rust

Memory Safety: Rust's compiler checks for potential memory safety issues at compile time, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors related to memory management. 
Concurrency: Rust provides strong guarantees around data races, making it a safer choice for concurrent programming. 
Performance: Rust's performance is comparable to C and C++ because it provides low-level control over memory and other system resources without sacrificing safety. 
By using Rust, you gain the benefits of a modern systems programming language that combines performance with safety, making it an excellent choice for writing secure and efficient malware scanners or any low-level system software.

Key Features:

Bytecode Decoding and Encoding: The script decodes and encodes bytecode using hex, allowing for easier pattern matching.

RAT Signature Scanning: The script checks for multiple known RAT signatures, including shellcode, infinite loops, NOP sleds, INT3 instructions, and syscall payloads.

CLI Parameters and Directory Traversal: The script supports a command-line interface that allows for full traversal of directories, scanning each file for RATs.

Efficient Directory Scanning: The script recursively scans through directories, analyzing all files it encounters.

How to Compile and Run:
Save the Script:

Save the script as rat_scanner.rs.

Compile the Script:

Use rustc to compile the script:

rustc mewtwo.rs -o mewtwo

Run the Script:
sudo ./mewtwo.rs

Additional Notes:

Error Handling: The script includes basic error handling to manage file read errors and decoding issues.

Signature Database: You can expand the known_rat_signatures vector with more bytecode patterns relevant to the RATs you are targeting.

Customization: Adjust the encoding/decoding logic as needed for the specific firmware or binary formats you're dealing with.

This Rust script provides a robust way to scan files or directories for hidden RATs by checking for known signatures within bytecode, and it can be easily expanded or integrated with other analysis tools.
